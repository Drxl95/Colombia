          <div class="collapsible-header">Why would I need an Expat Service?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Good Question. Anytime someone plans on relocating to a different country,
              planning and researching is paramount.
              There is a lot of information on the internet and it is easy to fall victim to "information overload."
              Our purpose is to educate and assist people during this period. Clients also have the option of meeting
              with us in person as well if they are interested in tours or housing.</span>

              is
              at
              the bottom of our pages.
              We also have 2 branch offices located in Bogotá and Santa Marta. At this time we can only offer
              advice for people interested in these three locations. Rest assured we plan on providing more options as
              we grow.
              Our experts reside in these cities as well, and have been for a very long time (10+ years).</span>

              Upon purchasing your package you will receive various emails, including a brief questionnaire and
              an email allowing you to schedule your "Pre-Move Consultation". Following that, you will be assigned a
              mentor who will be working
              with you throughout the entire process, which, if you purchased either the Plus or Premium Package,
              will last for 3 months beginning after your move-in date. The questionnaire will be used to create your
              Travel Plan and the "Pre-Move Consultation" is for discussing all the important information you need to
              plan
              and make your trip. It is also worth mentioning that your Travel Plan will be discussed in this
              consultation, which usually takes 1-2 hours. All consultations and tours are done by appointment.
