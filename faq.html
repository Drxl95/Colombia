        <h1>What is an Expat Service?</h1>
        <p>An expat service is a team of experts that help an individual (an expat) move to a different country.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="QanA__container">
        <h1>Why would I need an Expat Service?</h1>
        <p>Good Question.  Anytime someone plans on relocating to a different country, planning and research is paramount.  
            There is a lot of information on the internet and it is easy to fall victim to "information overload."  
            Our purpose is to educate and assist people during this period.  Clients also have the option of meeting with us in person as well if they are interested in tours or housing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="QanA__container">
        <h1>Where are you located?</h1>
        <p>We have three locations.  Our headquarters in is Medellin and that address is at the bottom of our pages. 
             We also have 2 branch offices located in Bogota and Santa Marta.  At this time we can only offer
            advice for people interested in these three locations.  Rest assured we plan on providing more options as we grow.  
            Our experts also reside in these cities as well, and have been for a very long time (10+ years).

        <h1>So how exactly does this service work?</h1>
        <p class="depends">This depends entirely on the service purchased. </p><br>
            <h3><u>Basic Plan</u>:</h3>
            <p class="h3-text">Our most basic plan is intended for people who would only like to plan their move from home.  First we will ask you questions about yourself, your interests, and 
            intentions regarding Colombia.  That way we can give you more concentrated advice that has been tailored specifically for you.
            After that comes the actual "Pre-Move Consultation"
            .  We offer consultations via Zoom, during which we 
            will briefly go over your tailored plan/advice (if you chose the basic plan), then educate you on your options for how to get here, where to stay and other necessary advice.  You will also have all this information sent
             to you via email.  Finally, you have the ability to send us unlimited questions via email.  We guarantee a response within <u>24 hours</u>.<br>
            
            <h3><u>Plus Plan</u>:</h3>
            <p  class="h3-text">The plus plan includes everything in the Basic Package, however the unlimited questions can also be asked in a skype/zoom call if desired.
            After this point, all other perks occur <u>once you have moved to your desired city.</u>  These perks include another consulation that is done in-person, where you will be given your 
            tailored plan and advice (discussed in detail), followed by a tour of the entire city where we will point out important places, especially the ones included in your tailored plan.  <u>Make sure you are taking notes of 
            some kind, as we can only do one tour per client.</u> This tour can go for several hours depending on your plan, certain locations, and city cirumstances so please schedule accordingly.  </p><br>
            
            <h3><u>Premium Package</u>:</h3>

            city tour or on another day.   We will also find an apartment for you via our connections-guaranteed.  Please make sure to read the policies on apartments at secure checkout. </p>

            and required to select "I agree". If you chose the Premium Plan then you will have another agreement regarding our policies on our apartment guarantee.
        After your payment has been submitted you will recieve a confirmation email, from there you may schedule your "Pre-Move Consultation". All other info you need
    will be sent to you via email.</p>
