		<p>Bogotá is the capital of and largest city in Colombia. It is a place of convergence for people from all around the country and is therefore diverse and multicultural. Within this city, the past and present come together. The city is also very green thanks to its parks and the hills that extend along its eastern boundary, dwarfed by their two highest points, Monserrate and Guadalupe. The landscape that the people of Bogotá enjoy daily—the sea of green that makes up the Andes mountain range, rising up in the east—would be nearly impossible to find in any other large city. But Bogotá also has the colors of modern buildings and authentic colonial roof tiles that are a true historical treasure from the colonial era.</p>

			<p>Santa Marta is pure flavor. The city's diversity is evident in its landscape, people, and each and every aspect of its culture; it is a destination that truly embraces its visitors and makes them feel at home.  What makes this city unique? Santa Marta's beautiful terrain is its most distinguishing feature: its unforgettable landscapes in which the green foliage, blue sea, yellow sun and sand, and the contrast between the beaches and the white-peaked Sierra Nevada, make Santa Marta a must-see destination.</p>
